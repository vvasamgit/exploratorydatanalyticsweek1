# Exploratory Dat Analytics for household energy usage

The plots shows household energy usage over a 2-day period in February, 2007.

Then input data is taken from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip and created R code to produce 4 graphs files in PNG format. 

The Plot1.R/Plot1.png shows histogram of household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)

The Plot2.R/Plot2.png shows line graph of global minute-averaged active power over a 2-day period in in February, 2007.

The Plot3.R/Plot3.png shows comparision of  three sub metering data over a 2-day period in in February, 2007 using line gragh. 

The Plot4.R/Plot4.png shows all four graphs side by side to compare  global minute-averaged active power over a 2-day period , voltage over  over a 2-day period , three sub metering info over a 2-day period and global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) over a 2-day period.
